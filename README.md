# trackship
A simple code for RK4 particle tracking.
We use poetry and cython.
Install the code with poetry install.
There are some examples in the example directory.
- plot_example_1.py shows a simple optimization based on the Powell algorithm
- plot_example_2.py shows how to track particles through a solution configuration.
- plot_example_3.py shows how to generate a gif to plot all the optimization steps.
